#  Project 3: Most Winningest Cities in Sports

# Background
The aim of our project is to see if the success of local sports teams impacts the economy of that metropolitan area. Weâ€™ll examine the relationship between the percent gain/loss winnings year over year in the top five cities and bottom five cities and the economy in that area, from 2001-2018. We also compared the percentage gain/loss winnings to the labor productivity, as well as, per capita.

# Software/Tools:
* Python
* Bokeh
* Pandas
* Excel
* SQL Alchemy
* GitHub
* Numpy

# Instructions
This assignment is broken down into the following tasks:

# Prepare the Data
1. Gather the data. Data Sources:
   * https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/winningest-cities-in-sports/
   * https://salarysport.com/
   * https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?datasetcode=FUA_CITY
   * https://www.statista.com/topics/963/national-football-league/#topicOverview
   * https://stathead.com/all/
   * https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=mlb_teams 

2. Clean the Data both in Excel, Python, and SQL Alchemy.

3. Determine the top five cities and bottom five cities we would focus on based on the average win percentage for each city:

# Data Visulizations
   * Top left represents the Win Rate
   * Top Right represents the Employment
   * Bottom left represents the Labor Productivity
   * Bottom right represents the GDP Change
     
1. Here are the four visualizations for Charlotte, which was one of our bottom five winning percentages.

Findings: We chose to focus on Charlotte due to the constant change in win and loss percentages YoY. This allowed us to see if there was any relationship with the other three graphs (Employment, Labor Productivity, and GDP Change). There does seem to be some sort of correlation as the win percentage goes down the Labor Productivity and GDP Change look to mirror this, as well as, when the win percentage rises.
 
2. Here are the four visualizations for San Antonio, which was one of our top five winning percentages.

Findings: San Antonio's only major sports (Spurs) has had success throughout the year, with good years, and championships, in years 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2014. An interesting note is that the years following their championships (excluding 2007 due to 08 economic collapse) the city's employment and labor productivity took slight dives, while yearly GDP change trended up.

3. Here are the four visualizations for Sacramento, which was one of our bottom five winning percentages.

Findings: Sacramento's Major league team, the Sacramento Kings, experienced great success up until around the years we start measuring (2001/2002). Interesting to note that as the franchise fell off, the yearly employment change was on a downward trend all the way up to the economic depression of 2008. The team, towards the end of the period that we examined, had a few season of improved which line up with small jumps in GDP yearly change. 

## Ethics: Regarding the ethihcs behind this project, the only cocern we could think of was pertaining to the aquistion of the data. The first set of data for city GDP, Labor productivity, and Labor numbers were from an open sourced website (OECD - Origanisation for economic Co-Operation and Develepoment) that keeps track of city data from all over the world and is useable to anyone who comes across their site. The Sports data we obtained was from a Website/Database called Stathead, which required a subscription to obtain all of data.Stathead, like OECD, states on their terms and conditions that the data is there for all to use, as long as the source of the data is cited.
