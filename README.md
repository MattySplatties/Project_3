#  Project 3: Most Winningest Cities in Sports

# Background
The aim of our project is to see if the success of local sports teams impacts the economy of that metropolitan area. Weâ€™ll examine the relationship between the percent gain/loss winnings year over year in the top five cities and bottom five cities and the economy in that area, from 2001-2018. We also compared the percentage gain/loss winnings to the labor productivity, as well as, per capita.

Software/Tools:
* Python
* Bokeh
* Pandas
* Excel
* SQL Alchemy
* GitHub
* Numpy
